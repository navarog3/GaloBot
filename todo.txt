===== Plans for making it a full-blown music bot =====

Use this to set a song's starttime: https://issuehunt.io/r/fent/node-ytdl-core/issues/838
- in the queue.connection.play() function, include { seek: X } where X is how many seconds into the song to start
- seems flakey and inconsistent, might not include this feature due to that

Planned commands:
/play
- accepts either a song or playlist link. if song, play it. if playlist, play first song and add rest to queue

/play-l
- accepts either a song or playlist link. if song, play it and repeat it. if playlist, play first song, add rest to queue, and repeat queue

/queue
- prints the current song queue to chat

/clear
- clears out the queue

/skip
- skips the current song and moves to the next one in the queue

/shuffle
- randomizes the current queue

/loop
