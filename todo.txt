(âœ…: Done, ðŸŸ¨: WIP, ðŸŸ¥: Not started)


## Commands

âœ…/play
- accepts a song, plays from the store if it's downloaded, else download it
- CLAs:
    - âœ…loop (run /loop after adding, looping song if song and queue if playlist)
    - âœ…shuffle (run /shuffle after adding)

âœ…/skip
- skips the current song and moves to the next one in the queue

âœ…/queue
- prints the current song queue to chat

âœ…/clear
- clears out the queue

âœ…/shuffle
- randomizes the order of the current queue

âœ…/loop
- CLAs:
    - âœ…song (loop just the one song)
    - âœ…queue (loop the entire queue)

âœ…/status
- Displays currently playing song, as well as if looping song and/or queue

ðŸŸ¥/customPlaylist
- Break into two commands. One saves the current queue as a playlist, second takes the name
  of a saved playlist and loads it into the queue


## Other features that aren't commands

âœ…Handle playlists
- âœ…handle just a raw playlist link without a first video

âœ…Remove easter egg and move media library to the bot's folder

âœ…Remove /status and add looping info to /queue

âœ…Make skip to some place in the queue a thing

âœ…Check every X seconds to see if it's the only one in the VC. If it is, disconnect

âœ…If response to Discord is longer than 2000 characters, it errors - limit /queue to like 20 songs or something, and show total count

ðŸŸ¥Add custom message when trying to fetch an age-restricted video (error 410)
- Prelimimary look makes this seem quite difficult, since error happens in a callback so can't try-catch it
- Tried adding cookies but didn't seem to work

ðŸŸ¥If song fails to download and creates an empty file, that song can't be played any more
- Try/catch to delete file if failure?
- Check file size before playing a song, if too small skip
