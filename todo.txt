Planned commands (âœ…: Done, ðŸŸ¨: WIP, ðŸŸ¥: Not started)
âœ…/play
- accepts a song, plays from the store if it's downloaded, else download it
- CLAs:
    - âœ…loop (run /loop after adding, looping song if song and queue if playlist)
    - âœ…shuffle (run /shuffle after adding)

âœ…/skip
- skips the current song and moves to the next one in the queue
- ðŸŸ¥figure out behavior if looping (song and/or queue) is turned on

âœ…/queue
- prints the current song queue to chat

âœ…/clear
- clears out the queue
-ðŸŸ¥Currently crashes the bot by firing the player.on(AudioPlayerStatus.Idle) event but empties the queue after the empty check is done

âœ…/shuffle
- randomizes the order of the current queue

âœ…/loop
- CLAs:
    - ðŸŸ¨song (loop just the one song)
    - ðŸŸ¨queue (loop the entire queue)
    - TODO: If both song loop and queue loop are on, don't loop queue as it will just keep adding the looping song to the end of the queue

ðŸŸ¥/help
- Lists all commands and their options

ðŸŸ¥/customPlaylist
- Extra credit command, do this once everything else is done
- Break into two commands. One saves the current queue as a playlist, second takes the name of a saved playlist and loads it into the queue

Other features that aren't commands
âœ…Handle playlists
- ðŸŸ¥handle just a raw playlist link without a first video

ðŸŸ¥If bot is the only one in a voice channel, disconnect and ?clear the queue?
